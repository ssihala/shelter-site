# Shelter.Seek

Shelters play a vital role in providing essential support and services to individuals and families in need. They offer a safe haven for those facing homelessness, domestic violence, or other challenging circumstances. Shelters provide basic necessities such as food, clothing, and temporary housing, as well as access to medical care, counseling, and other social services. However, many shelters are severely under-resourced, struggling to meet the growing demand for their services. Shelters are unable to communicate with both local and global communities about their needs in a manner adequate enough to provide for those in need. Shelter.Seek tackles this exact problem, through a webapp which is able to both allow for direct communications with those donating and with those in search of shelter and other services for which shelters are able to provide. 

## Features
### For Shelters and Donators
- Shelters are able to find themselves with the search option and register themselves to begin creating their wishlists. 
- The also are able to set the importance of an item, directly communicating the items needed at the shelter to the community.
### For Shelters and the Destitute 
- The map also shows what items are available at which shelter, allowing those in need to find the shelter that is able to accommodate them and provide for their needs.
