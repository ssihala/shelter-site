## Shelter Seek
Shelters often receive donations that don't match the needs of their organization. We created Shelter Seek to provide shelters a way to create wishlists of items that they would like to be donated. Furthermore, Shelter Seek serves vulnerable groups in our community by providing an accessible way to find nearby shelters that have items that they might need. The site has an interactive map where a visitor can enter a location and see all shelters in the area. Pin markers on the map contain relevant information such as address, phone numbers, and websites. Shelter organizations also have the opportunity to claim a shelter, creating an account. This allows them to create an inventory of items and rank them based on their importance (ex. Low - High). On the interactive map, regular users can then search the shelters in the area for certain items. For example, users that are interested in donating toothbrushes can search and may see red pins on the map, indicating an urgent need for the item. Conversely, people that need a toothbrush from a shelter could also see green pins, which indicate that the shelter has plenty in their inventory.
