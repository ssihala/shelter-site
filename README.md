### Shelter.Seek

Shelters play a vital role in providing essential support and services to individuals and families in need. They offer a safe haven for those facing homelessness, domestic violence, or other challenging circumstances. Shelters provide basic necessities such as food, clothing, and temporary housing, as well as access to medical care, counseling, and other social services. However, many shelters are severely under-resourced, struggling to meet the growing demand for their services. Shelters are unable to communicate with both local and global communities about their needs in a manner adequate enough to provide for those in need. Shelter.Seek tackles this exact problem, through a webapp which is able to both allow for direct communications with those donating and with those in search of shelter and other services for which shelters are able to provide.
