## Shelter Seek
Shelters often receive donations that don't match the needs of their organization. We created Shelter Seek to provide shelters a way to create wishlists of items that they would like to be donated. Furthermore, Shelter Seek serves vulnerable groups in our community by providing an accessible way to find nearby shelters that have items that they might need.
